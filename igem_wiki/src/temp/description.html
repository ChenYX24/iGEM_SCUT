              (Islam, Khan, & Tanaka, 2004) . The existing chemical methods of degradation fail to fully utilize

              During our interview with Prof.Luo, we discussed a lot about the biological ways to recycle shrimp shell.
              The chemical structure of shell waste is the trickiest factor in degradation. With
              <span>layers of protein-wrapped chitin piled up compactly</span>
              like wafer cookies, it's hard to get protein and chitin fully degraded(Demain & Sanchez, 2009). This
              structure requires bacterium equipped with
              <span>powerful proteinases and chitinases </span>

              which can fully degrade feathers, and they are now testing its ability to deal with other biomass waste,
              like the skin of fish and shrimp shell. With an inserted gene of powerful chitinase get efficiently
              expressed by the streptomyces, it can now realize the eco-friendly degradation of most chitin and proteins
              in shrimp shell at a recycle rate of
              <span> 92%, </span>

              This bacterium fits our vision of an industry
              <span> using shrimp shell as a cheap fermenting material for producing high-value chemicals.</span>
              That’s the perfect bacteria chassis to carry on further synthesis procedure. So, we get Prof.Luo’s
              permission to get involved in his research and ask him to be our P.I. Due to the high concentration of
              nitrogen containing chemicals like amino acids and chitin oligomer, we want to further update this
              bacterium to see if it can synthesize high value compounds containing nitrogen on the shell waste base.

                The synthesizing pathway begin with aspartic acid exists in the streptomyces we use. And the production
                can be promoted by switch the fermenting environment between low osmotic and high osmotic pressure. In
                our early attempts, we tested the production of ectoine in the bacterium. Moreover, through literature
                research, we have found the possible way to improve its producing rate—interfering with two branches on
                the Ectoine operon, which would be further displayed in Design.

                Nowadays, there are already products like milk and chocolate which is mixed with GABA for calming

                this study, but it is an intermediate that is hard to be accumulated. We still need further
                modifications on the genes downstream to see if the production would be strengthened.
